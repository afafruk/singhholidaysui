This guide covers the mountainous region known as Khevi, situated at the northern slopes of Greater Caucasus mountanis, north of Tbisili. Khevi (Georgian word for a 'gorge') is formed by three large valleys - Tergi, Truso and Snostskali. Its center is Stepantsminda village."},
      {"history5":"So, why is this a 'Kazbegi travel guide'? Mainly because that was the name of Stepantsminda village for last 200 years till it got renamed in 2006. But many people still use the word Kazbegi, it´s shorter, more convenient and resonates more (also thanks to the connection with Mt. Kazbek). No hustler at Didube station will offer you a 'taxi to Stepantsminda' - because by the time he finishes, you will be sitting in the taxi to Kazbegi."},
      {"history6":" Term Khevi would be accurate, too, but it's little-known abroad and could cause confusion with neighbouring Khevsureti region."}

In the XI century, the western and eastern Georgia were united into one kingdom, which existed until the XI century. By the end of the XI century, Georgia was divided into three independent states: Kartli, Kakheti and Imereti. Several principalities were created, one of which was Odishi. It covered the whole territory of present-day Samegrelo. From the middle of the XII century through the XIX century, Odishi was ruled by the representatives of the Dadiani family."},

In 1918, Georgia declared independence and Samegrelo became a part of the new democratic country. Today the territory of the principality of historic Samegrelo is part of Samegrelo-Zemo Svaneti administrative region."},

Ancient settlements, unique temples, and fortresses tell wonderful stories or myths, and the limit between legend and reality disappears. This side is a true oasis with beautiful valleys, waterfalls, lowlands or alpine lakes and many fascinating caves. Tobavarchkhili, which is tucked into the rocks creates an unforgettable impression for all visitors. Samegrelo also has an endemic species of Kolkheti National Reserve."}
